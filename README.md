## Overview
In this project, I utilized the cityPy Python library along with the OpenWeatherMap API to create a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. A graphical analysis was also performed to characterize the relationships between Temperature, Humidity, Cloudiness, and Wind Speed to latitude.
Additionally, a second analysis of the weather was used to determine ideal vacation locations based on ideal weather conditions - specifically Temperature, Wind Speed, and Cloudiness. As an output, a map was created that shows the hotel locations at the most ideal vacation destinations.
